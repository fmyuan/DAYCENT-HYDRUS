aufert          key for automatic fertilization
                aufert = 0.0:   no automatic fertilization
                aufert < 1.0:   automatic fertilizer may be applied to remove
                                some nutrient stress without increasing
                                nutrient concentration above the minimum 
                                level; the value of aufert is the fraction of
                                potential C production (temperature and
                                moisture limited) which will be maintained
                aufert > 1.0:   automatic fertilizer may be applied to remove
                                nutrient stress and increase nutrient
                                concentrations above the minimum level; a
                                value of aufert between 1.0 and 2.0 determines
                                the extent to which nutrient concentration is
                                maintained between the minimum and maximum
                                levels
                aufert = 2.0:   automatic fertilizer may be applied to remove
                                nutrient stress and increase nutrient
                                concentrations to the maximum level
            Range: 0 to 2

ninhib          reduction factor on nitrification rates due to nitrification
                inhibitors added with fertilizer, 1.0 = no reduction
            Range: 0.0 to 1.0

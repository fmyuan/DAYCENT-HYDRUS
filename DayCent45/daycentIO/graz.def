            Range: 0.0 to 1.0

grzeff          effect of grazing on production
                  = 0  grazing has no direct effect on production
                  = 1  linear impact on agp
                  = 2  quadratic impact on agp and root/shoot ratio
                  = 3  quadratic impact on root/shoot ratio
                  = 4  linear impact on root/shoot ratio

            Range: 0.0 to 1.0

fecf(2)         fraction of excreted P which goes into faeces (rest goes into
                urine)
            Range: 0.0 to 1.0

fecf(3)         fraction of excreted S which goes into faeces (rest goes into
                urine)
